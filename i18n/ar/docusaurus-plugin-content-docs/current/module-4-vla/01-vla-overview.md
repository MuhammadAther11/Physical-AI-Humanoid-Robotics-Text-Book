# Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems for humanoid robots.

## Introduction to VLA Systems

This section covers the core concepts and architecture of VLA systems.

### What are VLA Systems?

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems are integrated AI systems that connect visual perception, natural language understanding, and robot action execution. They enable robots to interpret and act upon natural language commands.

### Key Components

*   **Vision**: Robot's ability to perceive its environment.
*   **Language**: Understanding of natural language commands.
*   **Action**: Robot's capability to execute tasks.

### Why VLA Systems?

VLA systems are crucial for enabling more intuitive and flexible human-robot interaction, allowing robots to understand and respond to complex instructions in real-world scenarios.

## Testing and Acceptance Criteria

### User Story 1 - Understanding VLA Systems (Priority: P1)
**Goal**: Understand the core concepts and architecture of VLA systems.
**Independent Test**: Ability to describe VLA systems and their components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1.  **Given** I have read the introductory chapter on VLA systems, **When** asked to explain VLA, **Then** I can accurately describe its purpose and key components (vision, language, action integration).

**Potential Quiz Questions**:
1.  What is the primary goal of a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system?
2.  List the three main components of a VLA system.
3.  How do VLA systems facilitate more intuitive human-robot interaction?
