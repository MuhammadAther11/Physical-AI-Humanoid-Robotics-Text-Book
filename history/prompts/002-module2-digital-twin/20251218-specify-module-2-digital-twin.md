## Prompt

Module: Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) Audience: Students with ROS 2 and basic robotics knowledge Focus: Physics-based simulation and digital twin environments for humanoid robots Chapters: 1. Gazebo Physics: gravity, collisions, dynamics 2. Unity Environments: rendering and human–robot interaction 3. Sensor Simulation: LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs Success: - Explain digital twins in Physical AI - Configure Gazebo simulations - Build interactive Unity scenes - Simulate realistic sensors Constraints: - Markdown (Docusaurus) - Minimal runnable examples - Clear diagrams where needed Not building: - Game engines or hardware drivers

## Response snapshot

Specification created successfully.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the feature specification for 'Module 2 – The Digital Twin'.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files:
  - `specs/002-module2-digital-twin/spec.md`
  - `specs/002-module2-digital-twin/checklists/requirements.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan
- 🧠 Reflection: The shell environment caused issues with script execution, forcing a manual workaround. The `create-phr` script was also missing.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Shell command parsing, missing script.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
- Prompt variant (if applicable):
- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
