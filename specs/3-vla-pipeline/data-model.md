# Data Model: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

This module focuses on conceptual understanding of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems and their integration, rather than a traditional data model for persistence. The key entities below represent core concepts and their relationships within the educational content.

## Key Entities

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA) System
-   **Description**: An integrated AI system that connects visual perception, natural language understanding, and robot action execution to enable robots to respond to and act upon language-based commands.
-   **Attributes**: (Conceptual) Input modalities (vision, language), output modality (action), processing pipeline.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   Comprises: Whisper, LLM, ROS 2 integration.
    -   Acts upon: Humanoid Robot.

### Humanoid Robot
-   **Description**: A robot designed to resemble the human body's structure and movement capabilities. This module uses it as the target platform for VLA interactions.
-   **Attributes**: (Conceptual) Perception capabilities, action execution capabilities, communication interface (e.g., ROS 2).
-   **Relationships**:
    -   Controlled by: VLA System.

### Whisper
-   **Description**: A general-purpose speech-to-text model used for transcribing spoken language into text.
-   **Attributes**: (Conceptual) Accuracy, language support, output format (text).
-   **Relationships**:
    -   Input for: LLM for task planning, or directly for action triggering.
    -   Component of: Voice-to-Action pipeline.

### Large Language Model (LLM)
-   **Description**: An AI model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. In this context, it's used for interpreting complex language commands and generating task plans for robot actions.
-   **Attributes**: (Conceptual) Language understanding capabilities, planning and reasoning abilities, output format (structured actions/plans).
-   **Relationships**:
    -   Receives input from: Whisper (via text).
    -   Generates: Task plans for ROS 2.

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)
-   **Description**: A middleware framework for robot software development. It provides tools for communication, hardware abstraction, and task execution.
-   **Attributes**: (Conceptual) Publish/subscribe model, action servers, nodes, topics.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   Executes: Task plans generated by LLM.
    -   Controls: Humanoid Robot actions.

### Autonomous Humanoid Pipeline
-   **Description**: The end-to-end system that integrates voice input, language understanding, task planning, and robot action execution to enable autonomous operation of a humanoid robot based on natural language commands.
-   **Attributes**: (Conceptual) Workflow stages, data flow, control flow.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   Integrates: Whisper, LLM, ROS 2, Humanoid Robot.
