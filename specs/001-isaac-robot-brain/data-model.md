-   **Relationships**:
    -   Comprises: Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS.

### Isaac Sim
-   **Description**: A powerful, scalable robotics simulation application built on NVIDIA Omniverse. It is used for photorealistic simulation, generating synthetic data for AI model training, and testing robot autonomy.
-   **Attributes**: (Conceptual) Simulation features, synthetic data generation capabilities, integration with Omniverse.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   Component of: NVIDIA Isaac.
    -   Generates: Synthetic Data.

### Isaac ROS
-   **Description**: A collection of hardware-accelerated packages for ROS 2, designed to improve performance and capabilities for robotics applications, particularly in areas like perception and navigation.
-   **Attributes**: (Conceptual) Hardware acceleration features, specific perception/navigation algorithms, integration with ROS 2.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   Component of: NVIDIA Isaac.
    -   Utilizes: VSLAM (for perception).

### Nav2

-   **Relationships**:
    -   Navigated by: Nav2.
    -   Perceived by: Isaac ROS.

### Synthetic Data
-   **Description**: Data that is artificially generated rather than collected from real-world observations. In this context, it's used to train AI models, particularly when real-world data is scarce, expensive, or dangerous to acquire.
-   **Attributes**: (Conceptual) Generation methods, use cases (e.g., AI training, testing), characteristics (e.g., photorealistic, diverse).
-   **Relationships**:
    -   Generated by: Isaac Sim.
    -   Used for: AI model training (implied).

### VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
-   **Description**: A technique used by robots and autonomous vehicles to concurrently build a map of an unknown environment while at the same time tracking its own location within that map, primarily using visual sensor data.
-   **Attributes**: (Conceptual) Algorithms, sensor requirements, accuracy, robustness.
-   **Relationships**:
    -   Accelerated by: Isaac ROS.
    -   Component of: Humanoid Robot perception and navigation.
